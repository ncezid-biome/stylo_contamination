## Introduction

**ncezid-biome/stylo_contamination** is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to filter, downsample, assemble, and QC [ONT](https://nanoporetech.com/) longreads. It takes a samplesheet and FASTQ files as input, performs read filtering, contamination checks, downsampling to specified coverage, assembly, and Quality Control (QC).

> [!NOTE]
> This is a experimental version of the [stylo](https://github.com/ncezid-biome/stylo) pipeline, intended for a specific use case. Please see stylo for the orginal maintained pipeline (in review)

1. Filters low quality reads ([nanoq](https://github.com/esteinig/nanoq))
2. Checks for contamination and assigns a genus ([kalamari](https://github.com/lskatz/Kalamari))
3. Downsamples reads to specific coverage ([rasusa](https://github.com/mbhall88/rasusa))
4. Assembles reads ([Flye](https://github.com/mikolmogorov/Flye))
5. Reorients assembly ([Dnaapler](https://github.com/gbouras13/dnaapler))
6. Error correction ([Dorado polish](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado))
7. QCs assembly ([QUAST](https://github.com/ablab/quast))

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow.

> [!NOTE]
> This pipeline was tested using the following, other versions may work but are currently untested.
> 
> nf-core v2.14.1
> 
> nextflow v24.04.2
> 
> singularity v3.8.7

First, prepare a samplesheet with one fastq file (single-end) per row.

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq
sample1,/path/to/sample1.fastq.gz
sample2,/path/to/sample2.fastq.gz
sample3,/path/to/sample3.fastq.gz
sample4,/path/to/sample4.fastq.gz
sample5,/path/to/sample5.fastq.gz
```

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

```bash
nextflow run ncezid-biome/stylo_contamination \
   -r v1.0.0 \
   -profile singularity \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For CDC users, please see [CDC Usage](docs/CDC.md)

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details about usage see the [Usage Page](docs/usage.md)
